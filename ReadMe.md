What are we trying to make?
In this assessment, Calliope is back and has you working on a project for our local humane society. 

 

Based on Calliope's email:

You are working with the humane society to add a mini-game to their website.
The game should allow visitors to see teams of puppies compete in a "puppy bowl".
Someone has already built out the API.
Overall, your job is to build out a functional client side. Request data from the API, then render that data on the front end. The front end should allow the user to: 

View the roster.
Observe a player's details.
Etc.
See teams of players
Players compete
Add/remove players from roster
All the data you need is available through the API. Your job is to leverage it.
